# trip-tracker
If you work part-time as an Uber driver, it might be important to you that your car trips are tracked and that you know where you were on a certain date or how much you have traveled for Uber. This app is made for people like that.

The trips that are for Uber are color coded differently to those that are personal, which gives the user the ability to tell at first glance what kind of trips have they been taking more of as of recetly.

They can also search a specific date to see all the trips that they made that day. This is useful for invoices and things like that.

It is an Android app coded using Java.

It contains multiple fragments for the list of trips, for adding and deleting them, and so on. It has the full CRUD capabilities that an app like this should have. To edit a trip, you need only tap on one of the existing trips in the list, which will bring up an edit window, In this window, you can save the changes, cancel them, or delete the trip entirely.

In order to run it, you will need to use either a real Android device, or simply an emulator.
